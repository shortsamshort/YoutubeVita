## YouTube Backend
So I was thinking for the backend to reference the Lua scripts in VLC's own playlist parsers. This is tested and upkept by the VLC team making updates to the script easier. I have also looked at the formatting for Noburu's multiple manga site parsers. I think I may have to focus on that format to make the application very updateable and modular.

## User Experience
For this I have viewed various applications in the homebrew app store, the current official YouTube application for consoles and TVs, and also various mobile applications. I like Noburu's side bar style for the Vita, but I don't know if the scrolling list is good or if I should use the side-scrolling style the TV application uses. 

## Refactor and QA
As I am not a developer by trade there will be a LOT of refactoring and adjustments. I apologize in advance for this and if there are any tips or tricks that you have I am open to input. I am someone who learns from getting their hands dirty and making mistakes. I would love for someone to assist with QA and testing.
